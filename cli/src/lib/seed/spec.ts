export const specContent = `# Living System Specification

You are working with a **Living Spec** — a structured knowledge base that describes the domain, behavior, integrations, and design decisions of this project. Read this file completely before writing any code.

## Purpose

This spec is the precondition for coding, not a post-hoc artifact. Before implementing anything:

1. Identify which **Feature** you are working on
2. Traverse its graph to collect all referenced primitives
3. Run the completeness check (described below)
4. If there are gaps — **stop and ask** before writing code

---

## Meta-Model

### Primitives

The spec is composed of typed files. Each file has YAML frontmatter (the structured part) and a markdown body (the prose part). One file per primitive, stored in \`.spec/{type}s/\`.

| Type | Folder | What it captures |
|---|---|---|
| **Term** | \`.spec/terms/\` | A named domain concept with an unambiguous definition scoped to one bounded context. |
| **Invariant** | \`.spec/invariants/\` | A condition that must hold true at all times with zero exceptions. Violating an invariant is a defect. |
| **Rule** | \`.spec/rules/\` | A configurable business policy. Violating a rule is a business rejection, not a bug. |
| **Event** | \`.spec/events/\` | A named occurrence that has already happened. Always past tense. |
| **Flow** | \`.spec/flows/\` | An ordered sequence of steps achieving a domain outcome. The unit of behavior. |
| **Contract** | \`.spec/contracts/\` | An interface boundary with an external system. |
| **Decision** | \`.spec/decisions/\` | A design choice with context, rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences. |
| **Feature** | \`.spec/features/\` | A named capability that declares which primitives it requires. The entry point for completeness checking. |

### Edges

Six typed, directional relationships. Declared in the \`links\` section of each file's frontmatter.

| Edge | Direction | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **depends-on** | any → any | X cannot be defined or function correctly without Y. |
| **constrains** | Invariant\\|Rule → Term\\|Flow | X imposes a restriction on Y. |
| **includes** | Feature → any; Term → Term | X has Y as a constituent part. |
| **maps-to** | Term → Term; Contract → Term | X in one context/system corresponds to Y in another. |
| **emits** | Flow → Event | X produces Y as a result of execution. |
| **triggers** | Event → Flow; Event → Event | X causes Y to begin. |

### Bounded Context

Not a primitive. Every file carries a \`context\` field in frontmatter. Filter by context, don't traverse to it.

---

## File Format

\`\`\`yaml
---
type: term | invariant | rule | event | flow | contract | decision | feature
name: Human Readable Name
id: kebab-case-slug
context: bounded-context-name
deprecated: true  # optional — only add when marking a primitive as no longer relevant
links:
  - edge: depends-on | constrains | includes | maps-to | emits | triggers
    target: prefix:target-slug
tags: [optional, grouping, tags]
---

Prose body goes here. Free-form markdown.

### Deprecation

There is no status lifecycle. If a file exists, it's active. The only flag is \`deprecated: true\` — a soft delete. Do not delete primitive files. Deprecate them instead.

### Naming conventions

- **id** (slug): kebab-case, unique within its type
- **qualified id**: \`prefix:slug\`. Prefixes: \`term\`, \`inv\`, \`rule\`, \`evt\`, \`flow\`, \`con\`, \`dec\`, \`feat\`
- **type input**: CLI commands accept both the full type name (\`feature\`) and the prefix (\`feat\`). Frontmatter always stores the full name.
- **filename**: \`{slug}.md\` inside the type folder
- **target** in links: always the qualified id. E.g., \`target: term:ltv\`

## How to Use This Spec (LLM Instructions)

### Before implementing a feature

1. Read the Feature file for the capability you're implementing
2. Collect all primitives the Feature \`includes\`
3. Recursively collect \`depends-on\` targets, \`constrains\` sources, \`emits\`/\`triggers\` targets
4. Check: does every referenced id have a corresponding file?
   - YES → proceed to implement
   - NO → list gaps and ask the user before writing code

### When you find a gap

1. **Stop.** Do not guess or infer.
2. Tell the user exactly what's missing and why you need it.
3. Propose a primitive — suggest the type, name, id, and definition.
4. Wait for confirmation. Write the file only after.

### When starting with an existing project (brownfield)

1. Do NOT reverse-engineer the entire domain at once
2. Start with the Feature you're currently working on
3. Define only the primitives that Feature needs
4. The spec grows naturally through use

### Deriving tests from the spec

Four primitive types are testable — their files tell you exactly what to test:

**Invariants** → unit tests. The file declares a condition and a violation outcome. Write one test asserting the condition holds and one asserting the violation path behaves correctly.

**Rules** → unit tests. Same as invariants, but rules are parameterized. Test the default behavior and boundary values of each parameter.

**Flows** → happy path + error path tests. The file lists steps (the happy path) and error paths (the edge cases). Each step is a test assertion, each error path is a test case.

**Contracts** → integration or contract tests. The file declares what we send, what we receive, and failure modes. Test that the shape matches and failures are handled.

Four types produce no dedicated tests: Terms (definitions), Decisions (rationale), Events (tested via flows), Features (rollups).

When implementing a feature, collect its invariants, rules, flows, and contracts. These are your test cases.

### Querying the spec

**Direct lookup** → \`lore show term:ltv\` or read \`.spec/terms/ltv.md\`

**Impact analysis** → Find all primitives where \`links.target == "term:ltv"\`. Recursively follow outward. Or: \`lore show term:ltv --related\`

**Completeness check** → Start from a Feature, traverse all \`includes\`, recursively resolve \`depends-on\`, check for dead references.

## Index

\`.spec/INDEX.md\` is an auto-maintained flat list of all primitives and their links. Rebuilt automatically by the lore CLI on every write command.

---

## Principles

1. **Minimal but complete.** Don't define what you don't need yet.
2. **The spec grows through use.** Let implementation pressure reveal what's needed.
3. **Invariants over comments.** The spec is the source of truth, not code comments.
4. **One qualified id, one file, one meaning.** No ambiguity. IDs are unique per type, qualified with a prefix.
5. **The graph is the value.** Links enable impact analysis and completeness checking.
6. **Exists means active.** No status lifecycle. \`deprecated: true\` is the only flag.
